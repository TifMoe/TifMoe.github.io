I recently graduated from a full-time, immersive data science program called Metis and wanted to give a review of my experience.

Metis is an ACCET-accredited immersive twelve-week bootcamp-style program that teaches data science theory and 
technique in the context of real-world experience by requiring students to build out a portfolio of projects. They 
currently have campuses in New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago - I was in Chicago!  

Here's a picture of the Chicago team from the Winter 2018 cohort on career day:

They call this program a 'bootcamp' because 1) it's generally very intense, but also 2) because it gives students practical, 
hands-on experience in the field. 

In this review, I'll briefly discuss my experience with:

- Facilities
- Daily structure
- Curriculum
- Staff and instructors

but (spoiler alert!) I had a great experience :)

## Facilities
Ok, real talk, this is just a place for me to share pics so you can see how beautiful the space is. 
In Chicago, Metis shared this space with Dev Bootcamp until the fall of 2017 when Dev Bootcamp moved out... so our
little Metis cohort of 11 students had this whole place to ourselves!

I can't say how long Metis will stay in this giant space in Chicago, but it's definitely a nice place to be for now! 

## A Day in the Life
A typical day in the bootcamp might look like the following:

- 8:30am: People start trickling in and make coffee or tea, catch up on the couches outside the classroom space
- 9:00am: Class starts each day with a pair programming problem - we generally have an hour to do this
- 10:00am: At least one pair presents their solution to the class and then lectures begin!
- 12:00pm: After lectures in the morning, we break for lunch (sometimes there are career building workshops going on over lunch)
- 1:00pm: Gather back in the classroom for stand-up and announcements
- 1:30pm: The afternoons are generally reserved for independent work, group collaboration, and 1:1 questions with the
instructors
- 5:00pm: People are free to leave, though some stick around to put in a few extra hours, stay for a meetup event, or 
listen to a speaker that the Metis career team might bring in to share about their experience as a data scientist. 


## Curriculum
The Metis curriculum focuses on project design, machine learning, statistical modeling, visualization, and effective 
communication of results. 

#### Prework
One thing I really liked about Metis that I don't think is the case with some other bootcamps is that, after applicants go 
through a pretty intense three part application process, accepted students are then required to complete a bunch of 
pre-work in python, probability, statistics, calculus and linear algebra before the bootcamp begins. 

This really helps set a more level field as students tend to come from very different backgrounds. For example, I came in
with some good experience using python in a professional setting and felt comfortable with programming, but my formal education
(counseling!) didn't require any higher math so I was a super beginner in linear algebra and calculus before going through the prework. 
On the other hand, another student in my cohort had her PhD in mathematics but didn't have as much experience programming in python. 

#### Coursework
The beauty of the bootcamp is that it lays down a pretty solid foundation for learning data science no matter where you are coming from! 
They are big believers in teaching the fundamentals at Metis and spent significantly more time making sure we understood
gradient descent and the assumptions of linear regression than they did going over the newest deep learning frameworks.
No one should expect to leave any bootcamp as an expert in all of data science, but the Metis curriculum definitely equips 
students to go out in the world and dive deep into subjects that would probably not have been as accessible to them otherwise.

Another thing I really love about Metis's approach to teaching data science is that it's largely project based. We don't learn
theory in a vacuum but have to quickly apply principles we're learning in lecture to build out compelling data science projects
very quickly. In total there are five projects completed in the span of three months, these projects require:

1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Linear regression and web scraping
3. Classification and data visualization
4. Unsupervised learning - clustering, natural language processing, dimensionality reduction
5. Passion project - some combination of things learned in the course

This project-based approach requires us to learn quickly, but also creates a portfolio of work we can leverage in our job
search. Because the Metis curriculum require students to synthesize each of their projects into a short presentation after
each assignment, you also benefit from experience presenting complex, technical concepts to non technical audiences. 

This all culminates with a **Career Day** at the end of the bootcamp where Metis invites a roomful of hiring managers, 
data scientists and recruiters to hear students present their final passion project. 
  
## Staff
I loved the Metis staff and feel so fortunate that our cohort was led by [Alice Zhao](http://adashofdata.com/) and 
[David Ziganto](https://dziganto.github.io/). They are both amazing, successful data scientists who have worked in industry but now are
on staff with Metis full time. David and Alice were excellent teachers who are genuinely passionate about data science and 
go above and beyond for their students. 

I've been to other (not Metis!) data science courses where the instructors were clearly just phoning it in and clicking 
through jupyter notebooks they obviously didn't create. It was almost the opposite case at Metis where our instructors often
supplemented the core Metis curriculum with content they created or are especially passionate about.

In addition to the full time (world class!) instructional staff, our Chicago team also included [Ashley Purdy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleypurdy/),
the Chicago Career Advisor, [Nathan Vermeiren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathaneric/), who transitioned from Program Manager to the
Metis National Data Science Events Manager and [Caroline Csernus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-csernus-59b62111b/), the new
program manager at Metis. They were all super helpful during our time there! Ashley is a gem and the career support was fantastic with weekly career-building workshops, 1:1 meetings, and speakers.

I'm so glad to have taken the leap, quit my job and spent 3 months in this intensive, dedicated learning environment. In 
addition to the foundational knowledge I have now in the field of data science and the portfolio of projects completed during the
course, I also now have the benefit of the entire Metis network, which includes hundreds of alumni across the country! This 
network has already proven to be super valuable and I'm excited to join their ranks! 

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about my experience at Metis or in my continued journey into the world of
data science :)
