<h2> About the Blog</h2>

<p> As data science and analytic professionals, aren't we all just trying to draw out the story in our data, draw conclusions about the way the world is, or draw up plans for the future?</p>

<p>I think one of the best kept secrets of the data science industry is that we're a lot more like artists than our super mathy, speaking-in-code, robot-training public personas let on. From the obvious data visualization component of our job to the more subtle creative problem solving, feature-engineering, model-tuning aspects of data science, this career demands that we flex some serious creative muscles!</p>

<p><b>Drawing with Data</b> is a technical blog exploring these themes in the context of my own personal journey from artist to data scientist.</p>
